    "The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide a narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    ">Our project was to combine together multiple datasets to find what we considered to be the \"best\" neighborhood in Pittsburgh. We first had to think of what being the \"best\" neighborhood mean't to us. We settled on the idea of the best neighborhood being the neighborhood where it would be the best to speed. John was quick to find a few datasets that would be related to traffic and road statistics and we ended up using almost all of our original datasets. We didn't explore any alternatives as we knew this idea would be good and easily supportable with our acquired datasets."
